# Privacy Policy for Deluxe Santase 66 Card Game

**Effective Date:** July 18, 2025

Pazoff ("we," "us," or "our") operates the Deluxe Santase 66 Card Game mobile application (the "Service"). This page informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal data when you use our Service.

> **Your privacy is critically important to us. Deluxe Santase 66 Card Game is a fully offline game. We do not collect, store, transmit, or share any of your personal information.**

## 1. Information Collection and Use

We do not collect any personally identifiable information (PII) from our users. This includes, but is not limited to:
*   Name
*   Email address
*   Phone number
*   Location data
*   Device identifiers (e.g., Advertising ID)
*   Contacts
*   Photos or media

The application is designed to function without any connection to the internet and does not send any data to us or any third party.

## 2. Locally Stored Data (Non-Personal Information)

For the sole purpose of providing core game functionality, the Service saves a small amount of non-personal data locally on your device. This data is never transmitted off your device. This includes:

*   **Game State:** Your current game progress, such as card hands, scores, and the trump card, is saved so you can resume a game later.
*   **Game Settings:** Your in-game preferences, such as AI difficulty, target score, dark mode, and sound settings, are saved for your convenience.
*   **Game Statistics:** A simple, anonymous record of wins and losses against the AI ("Player Wins" vs. "AI Wins") is stored locally. This data is not associated with any personal identity.

This data is stored using Android's standard `SharedPreferences` system and is under your control. **Uninstalling the application will permanently delete all of its associated data from your device.**

## 3. Data Sharing and Third Parties

We do not share any data with third parties because the app does not collect or transmit any data from your device. The Service does not contain any third-party SDKs for analytics, advertising, or social media integration.

## 4. Children's Privacy

Our Service does not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children. As the application does not collect any personal information whatsoever, we are in full compliance with children's privacy regulations like COPPA.

## 5. Security

All game-related data is stored only on your local device. As the application is completely offline, there is no risk of data transmission or interception over a network.

## 6. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.
